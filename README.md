## About Me

I specialise in Business Intelligence, Analytics Engineering, and modern data platform development, transforming complex operational datasets into clear, actionable insight.

### Core Focus Areas

* Translate stakeholder requirements into scalable BI and analytics solutions
* Integrate data from multiple sources including SQL Server, Lakehouse platforms, APIs, and flat files
* Design and maintain ETL and transformation pipelines using SQL, Python, Microsoft Fabric, and cloud technologies
* Clean, validate, and transform datasets to ensure high data quality and trusted reporting
* Build scalable dimensional data models using star and snowflake schema design
* Develop high-performance Power BI semantic models, dashboards, and self-service reporting
* Perform advanced analysis to identify trends, patterns, and operational insights
* Deliver end-to-end analytics solutions aligned with business objectives

## Analytics Architecture Approach

```text
Data Sources
    ↓
Data Ingestion and ETL Pipelines
    ↓
Data Warehouse or Lakehouse Layer
    ↓
Semantic Model (Power BI / Fabric)
    ↓
Business Dashboards, Reporting and Insight
```

Repositories are structured to reflect real-world production workflows, emphasising scalable architecture, clean modelling practices, and end-to-end analytics engineering rather than standalone dashboards.

## Featured Projects

### SQL Server Data Warehousing — Dimensional Modelling and ETL

Design and development of scalable SQL Server warehouse solutions using star schema modelling, optimised indexing strategies, and structured transformation layers. Built to support enterprise-grade reporting with analytics-ready data models.

### SLA Email Analytics — Power Query and Power BI

Operational analytics dashboards analysing SLA compliance, backlog trends, and ownership performance. Includes data preparation, semantic modelling, and DAX optimisation for production-ready reporting.

### Audit Performance and CtC Analytics — Fabric, Power BI and SQL Server

End-to-end analytics solution leveraging SQL Server as the warehouse layer. Includes variance analysis between auditors and checkers, drillthrough reporting, question-level modelling, and impact classification.

### Azure Data Warehousing and Cloud Analytics

Implementation of modern Azure-based data platforms including warehouse and lakehouse patterns, medallion architecture concepts, and scalable data pipelines designed for enterprise BI workloads.

### AWS Data Engineering and Analytics Workloads

Cloud-focused projects demonstrating ingestion pipelines, transformation workflows, and analytics engineering practices using AWS services.
